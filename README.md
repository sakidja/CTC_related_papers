**Summary:**  
The Curvature–Transport Correspondence (CTC) proposes that field curvature across physical systems — from quantum effective mass to galactic rotation curves and cosmological density inference — arises from the divergence of underlying transport fluxes. This manuscript presents the core formulation, mathematical structure, and multi-scale implications.

**Summary:**
This manuscript extends the Curvature–Transport Correspondence to cosmic structure formation. In this framework, curvature arises from the divergence of a gravitational transport flux rather than from material density. Cosmic filaments emerge from spatial variations in divergence, black hole interiors avoid singularities through flux saturation, and the Higgs–Planck hierarchy reflects a transition in curvature-response stiffness. Together, these phenomena appear as manifestations of a single principle: curvature is the geometric response of a medium with finite transport capacity.

**Summary:**
The standard Big Bang picture assumes that spacetime already exists at the moment of origin and is driven to a singular state of infinite curvature and infinite density. The Curvature Transport Correspondence (CTC) offers a different beginning in which the vacuum is a physical medium with stiffness that controls whether curvature or fields can exist at all. This leads to the Big Start, a finite radius Planck phase vacuum state where gravitational transport is saturated and no geometric degrees of freedom are present. This state is a pre geometric and zero entropy vacuum, directly realizing the insight of Sir Roger Penrose that the Universe must begin in an exceptionally ordered condition. As expansion relaxes vacuum stiffness, the layers of physics appear in sequence: curvature mobility at rG, transverse and quantum modes at rT, Higgs condensation and the appearance of mass at rH, and finally a classical FRW spacetime at rS. Cosmogenesis and gravitational collapse follow the same divergence law in opposite directions, and the Big Start replaces the classical singularity with a natural vacuum phase transition in which spacetime, gravity, quantum behavior, and mass appear only when the vacuum becomes soft enough to support them

**Summary:**
Observed galactic rotation curves rise, bend, and remain flat at radii where a purely baryonic Newtonian potential predicts declining velocities. The conventional interpretation introduces non-luminous dark matter to supply the missing rotational support. Here we propose an alternative dynamical architecture based on rotational coherence transmission. In this framework the stellar disk is treated not as a set of mechanically isolated Keplerian annuli but as a continuum of energy-coupled shells capable of inheriting, transmitting, and eventually saturating rotational coherence from inner regions.
From this premise we derive three scale-free, falsifiable observables, namely the Curl Index, the Fractional Uplift, and the Surplus Index, quantify torque inheritance, rotational energy surplus, and radial coherence export. These indices can be computed directly from observed rotation curves without invoking additional mass. Applying the framework to the full SPARC database, we find that galaxies cluster into three dynamical regimes predicted by the model. The structured scaling of outer rotation curves is incompatible with strictly local baryonic dynamics but follows naturally from nonlocal torque transport. This particular work concerns only the dynamical inference drawn from galactic rotation curves. The framework is therefore offered as a galactic-scale dynamical alternative to the enclosed-mass interpretation.
