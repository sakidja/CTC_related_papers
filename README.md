**Summary:**  
The Curvature–Transport Correspondence (CTC) proposes that field curvature across physical systems — from quantum effective mass to galactic rotation curves and cosmological density inference — arises from the divergence of underlying transport fluxes. This manuscript presents the core formulation, mathematical structure, and multi-scale implications.

**Summary:**
This manuscript extends the Curvature–Transport Correspondence to cosmic structure formation. In this framework, curvature arises from the divergence of a gravitational transport flux rather than from material density. Cosmic filaments emerge from spatial variations in divergence, black hole interiors avoid singularities through flux saturation, and the Higgs–Planck hierarchy reflects a transition in curvature-response stiffness. Together, these phenomena appear as manifestations of a single principle: curvature is the geometric response of a medium with finite transport capacity.
